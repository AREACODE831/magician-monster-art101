# magician-monster
      I studied photography and specialized in darkroom photography. I used to love things I can actually touch and see in person. Then, when I took Art 74, all the digital and online new worlds came to me as a magical space or fantasy. Creating artwork in a space where I cannot see often made me feel like I am a magician. 
      Thus, I created a magician monster that can rain flowery rain and stop the moment. If you type  ‘m,’  it will show you the magic. Flowers imply the fantasy world that I encounter every day, and the magician monster is me who is one of all the superpower individual users in the online in the magical space: online. Type ‘x’  to remove the magic.
